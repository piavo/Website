<p>Hi! My name is Pia Vo, and I’m a fourth year biology major at The University of Texas at Austin. I’m also a pre-optometry student and love learning about the visual system! In my free time, you’ll usually find me outdoors, whether it be biking, hiking trails, or kayaking! Recently, I’ve been getting into baking pastries and painting. Thanks for dropping by and feel free to look around! If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to contact me at <a href="mailto:piavo@utexas.edu">piavo@utexas.edu</a></p>
