      <description>Hi! My name is Pia Vo, and I’m a fourth year biology major at The University of Texas at Austin. I’m also a pre-optometry student and have served as the volunteer coordinator and internal vice president for the Pre-Optometry Professional Society (POPS)! During my free time, you will usually find me outdoors, whether it be biking, hiking trails, or kayaking. Recently, I’ve gotten into baking pastries and painting which has been super therapeutic.</description>
